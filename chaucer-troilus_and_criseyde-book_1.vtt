BOOK I. Incipit Liber Primus

4
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,
That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,

5
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.289
In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,

6
00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.199
My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.

7
00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.710
Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte
Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte!

8
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.910
To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,
Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;

9
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.200
Help me, that am the sorwful instrument
That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne!

10
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.170
For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,
A woful wight to han a drery fere,

11
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.179
And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.

12
00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.690
For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,
Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,

13
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.820
Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,
So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;

14
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.530
But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse
To any lover, and his cause avayle,

15
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.820
Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle!

16
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.799
But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,
If any drope of pitee in yow be,

17
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.880
Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse
That ye han felt, and on the adversitee

18
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.039
Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;

19
00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.869
Or ye han wonne hym with to greet an ese.

20
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.130
And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas
Of Troilus, as ye may after here,

21
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.850
That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,
And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,

22
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.640
That I have might to shewe, in som manere,
Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,

23
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.570
In Troilus unsely aventure.

24
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.670
And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred
In love, that never nil recovered be,

25
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.920
And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred
Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;

26
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.730
Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,
So graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,

27
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.230
That been despeyred out of Loves grace.

28
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.180
And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,

29
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.540
And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,
That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.

30
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.890
For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,

31
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.300
And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee.

32
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.739
And for to have of hem compassioun
As though I were hir owene brother dere.

33
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.810
Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,
For now wol I gon streight to my matere,

34
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.520
In whiche ye may the double sorwes here
Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,

35
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.610
And how that she forsook him er she deyde.

36
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.540
It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge
In armes with a thousand shippes wente

37
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.459
To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,

38
00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.430
And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,
The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,

39
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.000
By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne.

40
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.079
Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was
Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,

41
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.019
A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,
That in science so expert was, that he

42
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.829
Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,
By answere of his god, that highte thus,

43
00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:32.980
Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.

44
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:42.500
So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,
And eek by answere of this Appollo,

45
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.140
That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,
Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,

46
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:56.630
He caste anoon out of the toun to go;
For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde

47
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.640
Destroyed ben, ye, wolde who-so nolde.

48
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.040
For which, for to departen softely
Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,

49
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.890
And to the Grekes ost ful prively
He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,

50
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.820
Hym deden bothe worship and servyse,
In trust that he hath conning hem to rede

51
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.770
In every peril which that is to drede.

52
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.960
The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,
Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,

53
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.510
That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed
With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken

54
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.760
On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
And seyden, he and al his kin at ones

55
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.910
Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.

56
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.160
Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,
Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,

57
00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.700
His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,
For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,

58
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.010
As she that niste what was best to rede;
For bothe a widowe was she, and allone

59
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.550
Of any freend to whom she dorste hir mone.

60
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.740
Criseyde was this lady name a-right;
As to my dome, in al Troyes citee

61
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.370
Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight
So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,

62
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.700
That lyk a thing immortal semed she,
As doth an hevenish parfit creature,

63
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.250
That doun were sent in scorning of nature.

64
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.520
This lady, which that al-day herde at ere
Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,

65
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.980
Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
In widewes habit large of samit broun,

66
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.850
On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;
With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,

67
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.100
His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge.

68
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.470
Now was this Ector pitous of nature,
And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,

69
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.670
And that she was so fair a creature;
Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,

70
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:18.740
And seyde, 'Lat your fadres treson goon
Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in

71
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.860
Ioye,
Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye.

72
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:31.010
'And al thonour that men may doon yow have,
As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,

73
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:38.770
Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,
As fer as I may ought enquere or here.'

74
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:45.780
And she him thonked with ful humble chere,
And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,

75
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.830
And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir
stille.

76
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:57.200
And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee
As to hir honour nede was to holde;

77
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.330
And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,
Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde

78
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.670
Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.

79
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:14.870
But whether that she children hadde or noon,
I rede it naught; therfore I late it goon.

80
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:21.960
The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,
Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;

81
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.690
For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,
And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe

82
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:35.150
The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte,
And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe

83
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.720
After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe.

84
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.550
But how this toun com to destruccioun
Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;

85
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:52.760
For it were a long digressioun
Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle.

86
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.340
But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,
In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,

87
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.890
Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.

88
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:09.450
But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,
And hir citee bisegede al a-boute,

89
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:16.620
Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,
As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;

90
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.650
But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
They hadde a relik hight Palladion,

91
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.270
That was hir trist a-boven everichon.

92
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:33.750
And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme
Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede

93
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:41.300
With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme,
And swote smellen floures whyte and rede,

94
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:48.430
In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede,
The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,

95
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.860
Palladiones feste for to holde.

96
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:58.930
And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse,
In general, ther wente many a wight,

97
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:04.620
To herknen of Palladion servyse;
And namely, so many a lusty knight,

98
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.930
So many a lady fresh and mayden bright,
Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,

99
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.780
Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.

100
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:21.340
Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,

101
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:29.190
Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
In beautee first so stood she, makelees;

102
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.250
Hir godly looking gladede al the prees.

103
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:39.120
Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre,
Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre

104
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.590
As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon
That hir behelden in hir blake wede;

105
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.710
And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,
Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,

106
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:59.920
And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,
Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere,

107
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.850
With ful assured loking and manere.

108
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:10.260
This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde
His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun

109
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:17.210
In thilke large temple on every syde,
Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun,

110
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:24.880
Now here, now there, for no devocioun
Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,

111
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.220
But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste.

112
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.900
And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten
If knight or squyer of his companye

113
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:42.100
Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten
On any woman that he coude aspye;

114
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:49.480
He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,
And seye him thus, 'god wot, she slepeth softe

115
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.610
For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!

116
00:11:53.610 --> 00:12:01.010
'I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,
Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,

117
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:08.080
And which a labour folk han in winninge
Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;

118
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:16.110
And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces;
O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye;

119
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.150
Ther nis not oon can war by other be.'

120
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:27.110
And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
Ascaunces, 'Lo! is this nought wysly spoken?'

121
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:34.990
At which the god of love gan loken rowe
Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken;

122
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:41.520
He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;
For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle;

123
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.930
And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.

124
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.350
O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!

125
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:55.740
How ofte falleth al theffect contraire
Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun;

126
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.380
For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.

127
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.370
This Troilus is clomben on the staire,
And litel weneth that he moot descenden.

128
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.340
But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden.

129
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.990
As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe
Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,

130
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:23.140
Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,
Than thenketh he, 'Though I praunce al biforn

131
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:30.440
First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,
Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe

132
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.400
I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.'

133
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:41.520
So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;
Though he a worthy kinges sone were,

134
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.279
And wende nothing hadde had swiche might
Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,

135
00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:55.840
Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,
That he, that now was most in pryde above,

136
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.589
Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love.

137
00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:05.990
For-thy ensample taketh of this man,
Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle,

138
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:13.550
To scornen Love, which that so sone can
The freedom of your hertes to him thralle;

139
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:19.670
For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
That Love is he that alle thing may binde;

140
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.240
For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde.

141
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:31.560
That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;
For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,

142
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.910
Men reden not that folk han gretter wit
Than they that han be most with love y-nome;

143
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:45.020
And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
The worthiest and grettest of degree:

144
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.610
This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.

145
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:56.830
And trewelich it sit wel to be so;
For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed;

146
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:03.430
And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
With love han ben conforted most and esed;

147
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:09.580
And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,
And worthy folk maad worthier of name,

148
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.620
And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame.

149
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:19.500
Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,
And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,

150
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:26.580
Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,
Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde.

151
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:34.279
The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde
Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede

152
00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:37.780
To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.

153
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:44.310
But for to tellen forth in special
As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,

154
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:49.470
And leten other thing collateral,
Of him thenke I my tale for to holde,

155
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:57.000
Both of his Ioye, and of his cares colde;
And al his werk, as touching this matere,

156
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.460
For I it gan, I wol ther-to refere.

157
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:07.060
With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,
This Troilus, of every wight aboute,

158
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:15.260
On this lady and now on that lokinge,
Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute:

159
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:22.460
And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route
His eye perced, and so depe it wente,

160
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.980
Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente.

161
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:33.589
And sodeynly he wax ther-with astoned,
And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse:

162
00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:37.160
'O mercy, god!' thoughte he, 'wher hastow
woned,

163
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.180
That art so fair and goodly to devyse?'

164
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:48.899
Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse,
And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,

165
00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:53.480
And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere.

166
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.390
She nas nat with the leste of hir stature,
But alle hir limes so wel answeringe

167
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:05.740
Weren to womanhode, that creature
Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.

168
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:12.250
And eek the pure wyse of here meninge
Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse

169
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.310
Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.

170
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:22.829
To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle
Gan for to lyke hir meninge and hir chere,

171
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:30.579
Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle
Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere,

172
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:31.800
Ascaunces, 'What!

173
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.429
May I not stonden here?'

174
00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:42.809
And after that hir loking gan she lighte,
That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.

175
00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:49.170
And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken
So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,

176
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:56.960
That in his herte botme gan to stiken
Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:

177
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.650
And though he erst hadde poured up and doun,
He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;

178
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.350
Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke.

179
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:15.080
Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge,
And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen,

180
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.790
Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yen;

181
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:28.760
That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen,
Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;

182
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.690
Blissed be love, that thus can folk converte!

183
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:40.260
She, this in blak, likinge to Troylus,
Over alle thyng, he stood for to biholde;

184
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:47.900
Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,
He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;

185
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:55.000
But from a-fer, his maner for to holde,
On other thing his look som-tyme he caste,

186
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.860
And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste.

187
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:06.330
And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,
Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,

188
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:12.040
Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped
Of loves folk, lest fully the descente

189
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:20.850
Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente,
Lest it were wist on any maner syde,

190
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.020
His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde.

191
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:30.700
Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth,

192
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:39.429
Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted,
Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth;

193
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:46.010
And al his chere and speche also he borneth;
And ay, of loves servants every whyle,

194
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.040
Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle.

195
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.670
And seyde, 'Lord, so ye live al in lest,
Ye loveres!

196
00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:01.710
For the conningest of yow,
That serveth most ententiflich and best,

197
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:09.410
Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow;
Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how!

198
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:17.150
Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse;
In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse!

199
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:26.300
'In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces,
But it a sely fewe poyntes be;

200
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:32.790
Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces
As doth youre lay, and that knowe alle ye;

201
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:39.260
But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;
But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve,

202
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.000
Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve!

203
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.220
'But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,
Or elles doon of good entencioun,

204
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:57.450
Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue,
And deme it harm in hir opinioun;

205
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:04.470
And yet if she, for other enchesoun,
Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon:

206
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.470
Lord!

207
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.750
wel is him that may be of yow oon!'

208
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:16.620
But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,
He held his pees, non other bote him gayned;

209
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:23.230
For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme,
That wel unnethe un-to his folk he fayned

210
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:31.200
That othere besye nedes him destrayned;
For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,

211
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.540
But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.

212
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:41.950
And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette,

213
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:49.059
And first be gan to syke, and eft to grone,
And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette,

214
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:57.360
That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette
That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse

215
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.750
Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse.

216
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:09.030
Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,
In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;

217
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:15.790
And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
It was to him a right good aventure

218
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:24.549
To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure
To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,

219
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:29.799
Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace.

220
00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:36.660
Imagininge that travaille nor grame
Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn

221
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:45.090
As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born

222
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:51.610
Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
Thus argumented he in his ginninge,

223
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.230
Ful unavysed of his wo cominge.

224
00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:01.990
Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,
And thoughte he wolde werken prively,

225
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:07.640
First, to hyden his desir in muwe
From every wight y-born, al-outrely,

226
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:14.950
But he mighte ought recovered be therby;
Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe

227
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:20.050
Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe.

228
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:28.710
And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
What for to speke, and what to holden inne,

229
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:35.610
And what to arten hir to love he soughte,
And on a song anoon-right to biginne,

230
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:42.510
And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;
For with good hope he gan fully assente

231
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.210
Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.

232
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:53.770
And of his song nought only the sentence,
As writ myn autour called Lollius,

233
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:59.470
But pleynly, save our tonges difference,
I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus

234
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:08.380
Seyde in his song, lo! every word right thus
As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here,

235
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.980
Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.

236
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.980
Cantus Troili.

237
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.230
'If no love is, O god, what fele I so?

238
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.110
And if love is, what thing and whiche is he!

239
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.720
If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?

240
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.570
If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,
Whenne every torment and adversitee

241
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:38.600
That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;
For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.

242
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:45.850
'And if that at myn owene lust I brenne,
Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte?

243
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.410
If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne?

244
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.080
I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte.

245
00:24:53.080 --> 00:25:00.560
O quike deeth, O swete harm so queynte,
How may of thee in me swich quantitee,

246
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.630
But-if that I consente that it be?

247
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:10.750
'And if that I consente, I wrongfully
Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro,

248
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:18.470
Al sterelees with inne a boot am I
A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two,

249
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.960
That in contrarie stonden ever-mo.

250
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.060
Allas! what is this wonder maladye?

251
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.640
For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.'

252
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:36.380
And to the god of love thus seyde he
With pitous voys, 'O lord, now youres is

253
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.940
My spirit, which that oughte youres be.

254
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.340
Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to
this;

255
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:50.350
But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis,
She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;

256
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.760
But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve.

257
00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:00.910
'Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,
As in a place un-to youre vertu digne;

258
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:08.950
Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I
May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne;

259
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:14.610
For myn estat royal here I resigne
In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere

260
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.110
Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.'

261
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:26.240
In him ne deyned sparen blood royal
The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse,

262
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.540
Ne him forbar in no degree, for al
His vertu or his excellent prowesse;

263
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:40.179
But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,
And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe,

264
00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:44.290
That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe.

265
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:52.200
So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,

266
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:59.860
That every other charge he sette at nought;
For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese,

267
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:06.650
To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;
For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende,

268
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.740
And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.

269
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:18.260
For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is,
This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye.

270
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:26.970
But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
By night or day, for wisdom or folye,

271
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:34.010
His herte, which that is his brestes ye,
Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene

272
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.110
Than ever were Eleyne or Polixene.

273
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:45.750
Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde,

274
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:52.929
'Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde,

275
00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:56.539
Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde!

276
00:27:56.539 --> 00:28:06.450
My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe
And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.'

277
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:12.350
Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
Both of the assege and his savacioun;

278
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:20.670
Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde
But argumentes to his conclusioun,

279
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:28.280
That she on him wolde han compassioun,
And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure;

280
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.539
Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure!

281
00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:40.620
The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,
That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,

282
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:48.110
Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve;
And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden,

283
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:55.710
Founde oon the beste, and lengest tyme abiden
Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle

284
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.830
In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle.

285
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:06.000
But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
Ne also for the rescous of the toun,

286
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.669
Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,
But only, lo, for this conclusioun,

287
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:19.490
To lyken hir the bet for his renoun;
Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,

288
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.770
That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde.

289
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.590
And fro this forth tho refte him love his
sleep,

290
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:34.840
And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe
Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep,

291
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.490
It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;
Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe

292
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:49.870
Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende
That the hote fyr of love him brende,

293
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:56.800
And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;
But how it was, certayn, can I not seye,

294
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:04.210
If that his lady understood not this,
Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;

295
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:11.240
But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,
Ne semed it as that she of him roughte,

296
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.990
Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte.

297
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:23.140
But than fel to this Troylus such wo,
That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede

298
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:30.010
Was this, that she som wight had loved so,
That never of him she wolde have taken hede;

299
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.299
For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte
blede.

300
00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:41.170
Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne
To tellen it, for al this world to winne.

301
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:50.080
But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,
Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne;

302
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:58.539
He sayde, 'O fool, now art thou in the snare,
That whilom Iapedest at loves peyne;

303
00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:06.280
Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne;
Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende

304
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.400
Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.

305
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:17.040
'What wol now every lover seyn of thee,
If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence

306
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.600
Laughen in scorn, and seyn, 'Lo, ther gooth
he,

307
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:27.190
That is the man of so gret sapience,
That held us lovers leest in reverence!

308
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:34.870
Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce
Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce!'

309
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:42.539
'But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde,
Sin thou most loven thurgh thi destinee,

310
00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:50.500
That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde
Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:

311
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:57.820
But al so cold in love, towardes thee,
Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,

312
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.690
And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone.'

313
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:08.280
'God wolde I were aryved in the port
Of deth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!

314
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:15.200
A, lord, to me it were a gret comfort;
Than were I quit of languisshing in drede.

315
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:21.840
For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede
I shal bi-Iaped been a thousand tyme

316
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.100
More than that fool of whos folye men ryme.

317
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:33.669
'But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom
I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste!

318
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:41.330
O mercy, dere herte, and help me from
The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste,

319
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:45.500
More than my-self wol love yow to my laste.

320
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:54.020
And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,
Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!'

321
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.610
This wordes and ful manye an-other to
He spak, and called ever in his compleynte

322
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:07.350
Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,
Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte.

323
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:15.049
Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;
And whan that he bithoughte on that folye,

324
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:18.560
A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye.

325
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.480
Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone,
A freend of his, that called was Pandare,

326
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:32.169
Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,
And say his freend in swich distresse and

327
00:33:32.169 --> 00:33:36.419
care:
'Allas!' quod he, 'who causeth al this fare?

328
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:37.840
O mercy, god!

329
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.120
What unhap may this mene?

330
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.100
Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?

331
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:49.720
'Or hastow som remors of conscience,
And art now falle in som devocioun,

332
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.679
And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,
And hast for ferde caught attricioun?

333
00:33:55.679 --> 00:34:03.659
God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,
And so can leye our Iolyte on presse,

334
00:34:03.659 --> 00:34:06.610
And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!'

335
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:13.300
These wordes seyde he for the nones alle,
That with swich thing he mighte him angry

336
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.270
maken,
And with an angre don his sorwe falle,

337
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:23.909
As for the tyme, and his corage awaken;
But wel he wist, as fer as tonges spaken,

338
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:29.369
Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse
Than he, ne more desired worthinesse.

339
00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:35.479
'What cas,' quod Troilus, 'or what aventure
Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge,

340
00:34:35.479 --> 00:34:37.829
That am refus of euery creature?

341
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:48.159
But for the love of god, at my preyinge,
Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge

342
00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:55.319
Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye;
Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye.

343
00:34:55.319 --> 00:35:03.879
'But if thou wene I be thus sik for drede,
It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought;

344
00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:08.780
Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede
Wel more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought,

345
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.819
Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and
thought.

346
00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:22.599
But though that I now telle thee it ne leste,
Be thou nought wrooth; I hyde it for the beste.'

347
00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:30.479
This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,
Ful often seyde, 'Allas! what may this be?

348
00:35:30.479 --> 00:35:36.969
Now freend,' quod he, 'if ever love or trouthe
Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me,

349
00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:42.819
Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee
To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care;

350
00:35:42.819 --> 00:35:46.759
Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare?

351
00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:52.229
'I wole parten with thee al thy peyne,
If it be so I do thee no comfort,

As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,
To entreparten wo, as glad desport.

353
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:06.059
I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,
In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve;

354
00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:09.509
Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.'

355
00:36:09.509 --> 00:36:18.069
Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,
And seyde him thus, "God leve it be my beste

356
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:25.930
To telle it thee; for sith it may thee lyke,
Yet wole I telle it, though myn herte breste;

And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste.

358
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:36.549
But lest thow deme I truste not to thee,
Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with

'Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth
Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth,

With disespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,
That streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth.

Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth,
That to ben slayn it were a gretter Ioye

To me than king of Grece been and Troye!

364

'Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,

So hyd it wel, I telle it never to mo;

'How hastow thus unkindely and longe
Hid this fro me, thou fool?'

371
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:46.520
'This were a wonder thing,' quod Troylus,
'Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;

'Ye, Troilus, now herke,' quod Pandare,
'Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,

By good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro.

432
00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:41.569
Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde,
But longe he ley as stille as he ded were;

433
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:48.069
And after this with sykinge he abreyde,
And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere,

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:53.990
And up his eyen caste he, that in fere

He sholde falle, or elles sone dye;

00:43:57.039 --> 00:44:01.609
And cryde 'A-wake' ful wonderly and sharpe;
'What?

437

441
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:25.969
And with that, Pandare of his wordes stente;
And Troilus yet him no word answerde,

For-why to telle nas not his entente
To never no man, for whom that he so ferde.

443
00:44:34.269 --> 00:44:40.130
For it is seyd, 'Man maketh ofte a yerde

Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;

448
00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.240
Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste.

449
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:14.760
But nathelees, whan he had herd him crye
'Awake!' he gan to syke wonder sore,

450
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:22.200
And seyde, 'Freend, though that I stille lye,
I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;

Lat be thyne olde ensaumples, I thee preye.'

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:49.770
'No,' quod tho Pandarus, 'therfore I seye,

'Why, nay,' quod he, 'by god and by my trouthe!'

463
00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:25.910
'What, Not as bisily,' quod Pandarus,
'As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede?'

'No, certes, brother,' quod this Troilus,
'And why?'

465
00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:33.450
— 'For that thou sholdest never spede.'

'Wostow that wel?'

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:13.450
Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,
Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:20.539
'I graunte wel that thou endurest wo

But I may not endure that thou dwelle
In so unskilful an opinioun

480

That of thy wo is no curacioun.

What womman coude love swich a wrecche?

'What may she demen other of thy deeth,
If thou thus deye, and she not why it is,

But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,
For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis?

And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele;

Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought.

What!

493
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:49.809
Many a man hath love ful dere y-bought
Twenty winter that his lady wiste,

494
00:48:49.809 --> 00:48:53.660
That never yet his lady mouth he kiste.

495
00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.660
'What?

496
00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.220
Shulde be therfor fallen in despeyr,
Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,

497
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.329
Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr?

498
00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:11.749
Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene
To serve and love his dere hertes quene,

499
00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:18.700
And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve
A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.'

500
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.880
Of that word took hede Troilus,

501
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:27.749
And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,
And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,

502
00:49:27.749 --> 00:49:34.170
That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne,
But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,

503
00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:41.420
And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;
For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte.

504
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:46.719
And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,
And seyde, 'Allas!

505
00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:49.539
What is me best to do?'

506
00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:56.220
To whom Pandare answered, 'If thee lyke,
The best is that thou telle me thy wo;

507
00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:03.559
And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,
I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,

508

To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!'

509
00:50:07.099 --> 00:50:10.690
'Ye, so thou seyst,' quod Troilus tho, 'allas!

510
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:18.049
But, god wot, it is not the rather so;
Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,

511
00:50:18.049 --> 00:50:24.479
For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,
Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go

512
00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:31.630
May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;
For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and

Quod Pandarus, 'Than blamestow Fortune
For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;

515
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:45.720
Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune
To every maner wight in som degree?

516
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.640
And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!

517
00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:55.940
That, as hir Ioyes moten over-goon,
So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon.

'For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,
Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:

Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may soiorne,
What wostow if hir mutabilitee

Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,
For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;

'A ha!' quod Pandare, 'Here biginneth game!'

And with that word he gan him for to shake,
And seyde, 'Theef, thou shalt hir name telle.'

533
00:52:16.579 --> 00:52:26.309
But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
As though men sholde han led him in-to helle,

534
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.309
And seyde, 'Allas!

656
01:03:14.769 --> 01:03:20.490
This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve
His fulle freend, than seyde in this manere,

657
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:26.539
'Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;
Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt

658
01:03:26.539 --> 01:03:28.200
wel here.'

659
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.880
—
And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,

660
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:38.990
And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,
And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place.

661
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:45.130
For every wight that hath an hous to founde
Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne

662
01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:52.579
With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,
And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne

663
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.140
Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.

664
01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:02.009
Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,
And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte.

665
01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:07.819
But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,
But up anoon up-on his stede bay,

666
01:04:07.819 --> 01:04:13.529
And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;
Wo was that Greek that with him mette that

667
01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:14.529
day.

668
01:04:14.529 --> 01:04:20.400
And in the toun his maner tho forth ay
So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,

669
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.549
That ech him lovede that loked on his face.

670
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:28.519
For he bicom the frendlyeste wight,
The gentileste, and eek the moste free,

671
01:04:28.519 --> 01:04:35.849
The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,
That in his tyme was, or mighte be.

672
01:04:35.849 --> 01:04:42.410
Dede were his Iapes and his crueltee,
His heighe port and his manere estraunge,

673
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.880
And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge.

674
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:54.269
Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,
That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore,

675
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:58.369
And is somdel of akinge of his wounde
Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more:

676
01:04:58.369 --> 01:05:04.900
And, as an esy pacient, the lore
Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;

677
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:11.309
And thus he dryveth forth his aventure.
