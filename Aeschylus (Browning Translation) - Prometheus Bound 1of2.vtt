00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.419
Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus
Translated by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.740
- 1861)

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.080
Recording by Expatriate in Bangor, Maine

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.159
SCENE.--_STRENGTH and FORCE, HEPHÆSTUS and
PROMETHEUS, at the

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.630
Rocks._

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.310
_Strength._ We reach the utmost limit of the
earth,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.199
The Scythian track, the desert without man.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.719
And now, Hephæstus, thou must needs fulfil
The mandate of our Father, and with links

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.850
Indissoluble of adamantine chains
Fasten against this beetling precipice

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.840
This guilty god.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.510
Because he filched away
Thine own bright flower, the glory of plastic

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.820
fire,
And gifted mortals with it,--such a sin

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.510
It doth behove he expiate to the gods,
Learning to accept the empery of Zeus

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.190
And leave off his old trick of loving man.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.930
_Hephæstus._ O Strength and Force, for you,
our Zeus's will

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.160
Presents a deed for doing, no more!--but _I_,
I lack your daring, up this storm-rent chasm

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.080
To fix with violent hands a kindred god,
Howbeit necessity compels me so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.240
That I must dare it, and our Zeus commands
With a most inevitable word.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.400
Ho, thou!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.950
High-thoughted son of Themis who is sage!

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.420
Thee loth, I loth must rivet fast in chains
Against this rocky height unclomb by man,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.320
Where never human voice nor face shall find
Out thee who lov'st them, and thy beauty's

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.500
flower,
Scorched in the sun's clear heat, shall fade

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.610
away.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.160
Night shall come up with garniture of stars
To comfort thee with shadow, and the sun

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.600
Disperse with retrickt beams the morning-frosts,
But through all changes sense of present woe

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.810
Shall vex thee sore, because with none of
them

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.250
There comes a hand to free.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.950
Such fruit is plucked
From love of man! and in that thou, a god,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.780
Didst brave the wrath of gods and give away
Undue respect to mortals, for that crime

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.530
Thou art adjudged to guard this joyless rock,
Erect, unslumbering, bending not the knee,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.340
And many a cry and unavailing moan
To utter on the air.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.500
For Zeus is stern
And new-made kings are cruel.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.510
_Strength._ Be it so.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.950
Why loiter in vain pity?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.640
Why not hate
A god the gods hate? one too who betrayed

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.850
Thy glory unto men?

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.780
_Hephæstus._ An awful thing
Is kinship joined to friendship.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.850
_Strength._ Grant it be;
Is disobedience to the Father's word

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.780
A possible thing?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.880
Dost quail not more for that?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.650
_Hephæstus._ Thou, at least, art a stern
one: ever bold.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.940
_Strength._ Why, if I wept, it were no remedy;
And do not _thou_ spend labour on the air

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.790
To bootless uses.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.500
_Hephæstus._ Cursed handicraft!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.070
I curse and hate thee, O my craft!

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.750
_Strength._ Why hate
Thy craft most plainly innocent of all

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.020
These pending ills?

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.709
_Hephæstus._ I would some other hand
Were here to work it!

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.520
_Strength._ All work hath its pain,
Except to rule the gods.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.459
There is none free
Except King Zeus.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.209
_Hephæstus._ I know it very well:
I argue not against it.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.500
_Strength._ Why not, then,
Make haste and lock the fetters over HIM

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.459
Lest Zeus behold thee lagging?

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.950
_Hephæstus._ Here be chains.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.150
Zeus may behold these.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.090
_Strength._ Seize him: strike amain:
Strike with the hammer on each side his hands--

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.180
Rivet him to the rock.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.570
_Hephæstus._ The work is done,
And thoroughly done.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.260
_Strength._ Still faster grapple him;
Wedge him in deeper: leave no inch to stir.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.030
He's terrible for finding a way out
From the irremediable.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.049
_Hephæstus._ Here's an arm, at least,
Grappled past freeing.

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.080
_Strength._ Now then, buckle me
The other securely.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.720
Let this wise one learn
He's duller than our Zeus.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.050
_Hephæstus._ Oh, none but he
Accuse me justly.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.520
_Strength._ Now, straight through the chest,
Take him and bite him with the clenching tooth

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.870
Of the adamantine wedge, and rivet him.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.610
_Hephæstus._ Alas, Prometheus, what thou
sufferest here

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.840
I sorrow over.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.020
_Strength._ Dost thou flinch again
And breathe groans for the enemies of Zeus?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.169
Beware lest thine own pity find thee out.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.969
_Hephæstus._ Thou dost behold a spectacle
that turns

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.749
The sight o' the eyes to pity.

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.830
_Strength._ I behold
A sinner suffer his sin's penalty.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.169
But lash the thongs about his sides.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.610
_Hephæstus._ So much,
I must do.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.830
Urge no farther than I must.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.600
_Strength._ Ay, but I _will_ urge!--and, with
shout on shout,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.169
Will hound thee at this quarry.

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.009
Get thee down
And ring amain the iron round his legs.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.569
_Hephæstus._ That work was not long doing.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.789
_Strength._ Heavily now
Let fall the strokes upon the perforant gyves:

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.210
For He who rates the work has a heavy hand.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.979
_Hephæstus._ Thy speech is savage as thy
shape.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.729
_Strength._ Be thou
Gentle and tender! but revile not me

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.539
For the firm will and the untruckling hate.

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.339
_Hephæstus._ Let us go.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.439
He is netted round with chains.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.419
_Strength._ Here, now, taunt on! and having
spoiled the gods

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.169
Of honours, crown withal thy mortal men
Who live a whole day out.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.759
Why how could _they_
Draw off from thee one single of thy griefs?

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.979
Methinks the Dæmons gave thee a wrong name,
"Prometheus," which means Providence,--because

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:26.689
Thou dost thyself need providence to see
Thy roll and ruin from the top of doom.

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:32.669
_Prometheus (alone)._ O holy Æther, and swift-wingèd
Winds,

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.409
And River-wells, and laughter innumerous
Of yon sea-waves!

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:43.379
Earth, mother of us all,
And all-viewing cyclic Sun, I cry on you,--

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.110
Behold me, a god, what I endure from gods!

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.849
Behold, with throe on throe,
How, wasted by this woe,

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.180
I wrestle down the myriad years of time!

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.009
Behold, how fast around me,
The new King of the happy ones sublime

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.580
Has flung the chain he forged, has shamed
and bound me!

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.539
Woe, woe! to-day's woe and the coming morrow's
I cover with one groan.

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:14.340
And where is found me
A limit to these sorrows?

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.449
And yet what word do I say?

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.300
I have foreknown
Clearly all things that should be; nothing

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.919
done
Comes sudden to my soul; and I must bear

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.360
What is ordained with patience, being aware
Necessity doth front the universe

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.889
With an invincible gesture.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.930
Yet this curse
Which strikes me now, I find it hard to brave

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.490
In silence or in speech.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.939
Because I gave
Honour to mortals, I have yoked my soul

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:44.060
To this compelling fate.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.780
Because I stole
The secret fount of fire, whose bubbles went

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:54.229
Over the ferule's brim, and manward sent
Art's mighty means and perfect rudiment,

00:07:54.229 --> 00:08:00.250
That sin I expiate in this agony,
Hung here in fetters, 'neath the blanching

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.250
sky.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.879
Ah, ah me!

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:07.550
what a sound,
What a fragrance sweeps up from a pinion unseen

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:13.839
Of a god, or a mortal, or nature between,
Sweeping up to this rock where the earth has

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:16.909
her bound,
To have sight of my pangs or some guerdon

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:17.909
obtain.

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:21.649
Lo, a god in the anguish, a god in the chain!

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:26.039
The god, Zeus hateth sore
And his gods hate again,

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:31.960
As many as tread on his glorified floor,
Because I loved mortals too much evermore.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.479
Alas me!

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:37.969
what a murmur and motion I hear,
As of birds flying near!

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:41.630
And the air undersings
The light stroke of their wings--

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.290
And all life that approaches I wait for in
fear.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:51.240
_Chorus of Sea Nymphs, 1st Strophe._
Fear nothing! our troop

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.490
Floats lovingly up
With a quick-oaring stroke

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.520
Of wings steered to the rock,
Having softened the soul of our father below.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.100
For the gales of swift-bearing have sent me
a sound,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.889
And the clank of the iron, the malleted blow,
Smote down the profound

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:12.540
Of my caverns of old,
And struck the red light in a blush from my

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.470
brow,--
Till I sprang up unsandaled, in haste to behold,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.800
And rushed forth on my chariot of wings manifold.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.949
_Prometheus._ Alas me!--alas me!

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:31.000
Ye offspring of Tethys who bore at her breast
Many children, and eke of Oceanus, he

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.480
Coiling still around earth with perpetual
unrest!

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.360
Behold me and see
How transfixed with the fang

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.690
Of a fetter I hang
On the high-jutting rocks of this fissure

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.980
and keep
An uncoveted watch o'er the world and the

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.019
deep.

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:54.250
_Chorus, 1st Antistrophe._
I behold thee, Prometheus; yet now, yet now,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.380
A terrible cloud whose rain is tears
Sweeps over mine eyes that witness how

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.690
Thy body appears
Hung awaste on the rocks by infrangible chains:

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:10.720
For new is the Hand, new the rudder that steers
The ship of Olympus through surge and wind--

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.839
And of old things passed, no track is behind.

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:20.050
_Prometheus._ Under earth, under Hades
Where the home of the shade is,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.480
All into the deep, deep Tartarus,
I would he had hurled me adown.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.720
I would he had plunged me, fastened thus
In the knotted chain with the savage clang,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.800
All into the dark where there should be none,
Neither god nor another, to laugh and see.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.949
But now the winds sing through and shake
The hurtling chains wherein I hang,

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:46.630
And I, in my naked sorrows, make
Much mirth for my enemy.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:53.500
_Chorus, 2nd Strophe._
Nay! who of the gods hath a heart so stern

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.339
As to use thy woe for a mock and mirth?

00:10:56.339 --> 00:11:00.620
Who would not turn more mild to learn
Thy sorrows? who of the heaven and earth

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.339
Save Zeus?

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:04.129
But he
Right wrathfully

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:10.010
Bears on his sceptral soul unbent
And rules thereby the heavenly seed,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.990
Nor will he pause till he content
His thirsty heart in a finished deed;

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.259
Or till Another shall appear,
To win by fraud, to seize by fear

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:22.069
The hard-to-be-captured government.

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:26.139
_Prometheus._ Yet even of _me_ he shall have
need,

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:30.709
That monarch of the blessed seed,
Of me, of me, who now am cursed

00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:34.910
By his fetters dire,--
To wring my secret out withal

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.589
And learn by whom his sceptre shall
Be filched from him--as was, at first,

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:40.890
His heavenly fire.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.360
But he never shall enchant me
With his honey-lipped persuasion;

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.069
Never, never shall he daunt me
With the oath and threat of passion

00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:54.430
Into speaking as they want me,
Till he loose this savage chain,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.399
And accept the expiation
Of my sorrow, in his pain.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:04.220
_Chorus, 2nd Antistrophe._
Thou art, sooth, a brave god,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.060
And, for all thou hast borne
From the stroke of the rod,

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.569
Nought relaxest from scorn.

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:13.970
But thou speakest unto me
Too free and unworn;

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.589
And a terror strikes through me
And festers my soul

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:20.279
And I fear, in the roll
Of the storm, for thy fate

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:25.339
In the ship far from shore:
Since the son of Saturnus is hard in his hate

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:28.380
And unmoved in his heart evermore.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:35.410
_Prometheus._ I know that Zeus is stern;
I know he metes his justice by his will;

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.569
And yet, his soul shall learn
More softness when once broken by this ill:

00:12:40.569 --> 00:12:45.370
And curbing his unconquerable vaunt
He shall rush on in fear to meet with me

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:51.040
Who rush to meet with him in agony,
To issues of harmonious covenant.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.180
_Chorus._ Remove the veil from all things
and relate

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.379
The story to us,--of what crime accused,
Zeus smites thee with dishonourable pangs.

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:05.079
Speak: if to teach us do not grieve thyself.

00:13:05.079 --> 00:13:09.370
_Prometheus._ The utterance of these things
is torture to me,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:15.480
But so, too, is their silence; each way lies
Woe strong as fate.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.899
When gods began with wrath,
And war rose up between their starry brows,

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:26.310
Some choosing to cast Chronos from his throne
That Zeus might king it there, and some in

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.120
haste
With opposite oaths that they would have no

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.009
Zeus
To rule the gods for ever,--I, who brought

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:38.610
The counsel I thought meetest, could not move
The Titans, children of the Heaven and Earth,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:44.209
What time, disdaining in their rugged souls
My subtle machinations, they assumed

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:47.649
It was an easy thing for force to take
The mastery of fate.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:52.079
My mother, then,
Who is called not only Themis but Earth too,

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:57.839
(Her single beauty joys in many names)
Did teach me with reiterant prophecy

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.519
What future should be, and how conquering
gods

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:06.810
Should not prevail by strength and violence
But by guile only.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.269
When I told them so,
They would not deign to contemplate the truth

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:15.560
On all sides round; whereat I deemed it best
To lead my willing mother upwardly

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.810
And set my Themis face to face with Zeus
As willing to receive her.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.459
Tartarus,
With its abysmal cloister of the Dark,

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:28.990
Because I gave that counsel, covers up
The antique Chronos and his siding hosts,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:35.279
And, by that counsel helped, the king of gods
Hath recompensed me with these bitter pangs:

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.560
For kingship wears a cancer at the heart,--
Distrust in friendship.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.360
Do ye also ask
What crime it is for which he tortures me?

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.710
That shall be clear before you.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.100
When at first
He filled his father's throne, he instantly

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.149
Made various gifts of glory to the gods
And dealt the empire out.

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:59.000
Alone of men,
Of miserable men, he took no count,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.610
But yearned to sweep their track off from
the world

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.920
And plant a newer race there.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.069
Not a god
Resisted such desire except myself.

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:08.529
_I_ dared it!

00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:13.290
_I_ drew mortals back to light,
From meditated ruin deep as hell!

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:20.110
For which wrong, I am bent down in these pangs
Dreadful to suffer, mournful to behold,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.459
And I, who pitied man, am thought myself
Unworthy of pity; while I render out

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:28.790
Deep rhythms of anguish 'neath the harping
hand

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.240
That strikes me thus--a sight to shame your
Zeus!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.100
_Chorus._ Hard as thy chains and cold as all
these rocks

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.879
Is he, Prometheus, who withholds his heart

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.749
From joining in thy woe.

00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:47.809
I yearned before
To fly this sight; and, now I gaze on it,

00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:49.850
I sicken inwards.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:55.629
_Prometheus._ To my friends, indeed,
I must be a sad sight.

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:59.670
_Chorus._ And didst thou sin
No more than so?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:05.459
_Prometheus._ I did restrain besides
My mortals from premeditating death.

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:09.680
_Chorus._ How didst thou medicine the plague-fear
of death?

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.170
_Prometheus._ I set blind Hopes to inhabit
in their house.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.079
_Chorus._ By that gift thou didst help thy
mortals well.

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:21.540
_Prometheus._ I gave them also fire.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.870
_Chorus._ And have they now,
Those creatures of a day, the red-eyed fire?

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.350
_Prometheus._ They have: and shall learn by
it many arts.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.569
_Chorus._ And truly for such sins Zeus tortures
thee

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:37.759
And will remit no anguish?

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:41.149
Is there set
No limit before thee to thine agony?

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:46.089
_Prometheus._ No other: only what seems good
to HIM.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:49.199
_Chorus._ And how will it seem good?

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.379
what hope remains?

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:53.399
Seest thou not that thou hast sinned?

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:58.540
But that thou hast sinned
It glads me not to speak of, and grieves thee:

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.040
Then let it pass from both, and seek thyself
Some outlet from distress.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.110
_Prometheus._ It is in truth
An easy thing to stand aloof from pain

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.080
And lavish exhortation and advice
On one vexed sorely by it.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.690
I have known
All in prevision.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.750
By my choice, my choice,
I freely sinned--I will confess my sin--

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.020
And helping mortals, found my own despair.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:30.660
I did not think indeed that I should pine
Beneath such pangs against such skyey rocks,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.240
Doomed to this drear hill and no neighbouring
Of any life: but mourn not ye for griefs

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:43.200
I bear to-day: hear rather, dropping down
To the plain, how other woes creep on to me,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.530
And learn the consummation of my doom.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.270
Beseech you, nymphs, beseech you, grieve for
me

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:56.520
Who now am grieving; for Grief walks the earth,
And sits down at the foot of each by turns.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.540
_Chorus._ We hear the deep clash of thy words,
Prometheus, and obey.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.840
And I spring with a rapid foot away
From the rushing car and the holy air,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.760
The track of birds;
And I drop to the rugged ground and there

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:17.370
Await the tale of thy despair.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.370
_OCEANUS enters._

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.700
_Oceanus._ I reach the bourn of my weary road
Where I may see and answer thee,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.270
Prometheus, in thine agony.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.970
On the back of the quick-winged bird I glode,
And I bridled him in

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.630
With the will of a god.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.470
Behold, thy sorrow aches in me
Constrained by the force of kin.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.360
Nay, though that tie were all undone,
For the life of none beneath the sun

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.640
Would I seek a larger benison
Than I seek for thine.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.070
And thou shalt learn my words are truth,--
That no fair parlance of the mouth

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.450
Grows falsely out of mine.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:56.320
Now give me a deed to prove my faith;
For no faster friend is named in breath

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.000
Than I, Oceanus, am thine.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.960
_Prometheus._ Ha! what has brought thee?

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.320
Hast thou also come
To look upon my woe?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.990
How hast thou dared
To leave the depths called after thee, the

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.540
caves
Self-hewn and self-roofed with spontaneous

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.410
rock,
To visit earth, the mother of my chain?

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.830
Hast come indeed to view my doom and mourn
That I should sorrow thus?

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.820
Gaze on, and see
How I, the fast friend of your Zeus,--how

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.870
I
The erector of the empire in his hand,

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.580
Am bent beneath that hand, in this despair.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.780
_Oceanus._ Prometheus, I behold: and I would
fain

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.940
Exhort thee, though already subtle enough,
To a better wisdom.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.660
Titan, know thyself,
And take new softness to thy manners since

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.080
A new king rules the gods.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.130
If words like these,
Harsh words and trenchant, thou wilt fling

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.170
abroad,
Zeus haply, though he sit so far and high,

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.260
May hear thee do it, and so, this wrath of
his

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.020
Which now affects thee fiercely, shall appear
A mere child's sport at vengeance.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.220
Wretched god,
Rather dismiss the passion which thou hast,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.550
And seek a change from grief.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.770
Perhaps I seem
To address thee with old saws and outworn

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.590
sense,--
Yet such a curse, Prometheus, surely waits

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:24.970
On lips that speak too proudly: thou, meantime,
Art none the meeker, nor dost yield a jot

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.960
To evil circumstance, preparing still
To swell the account of grief with other griefs

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.360
Than what are borne.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.820
Beseech thee, use me then
For counsel: do not spurn against the pricks,--

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.750
Seeing that who reigns, reigns by cruelty
Instead of right.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:48.070
And now, I go from hence,
And will endeavour if a power of mine

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.720
Can break thy fetters through.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.130
For thee,--be calm,
And smooth thy words from passion.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.450
Knowest thou not
Of perfect knowledge, thou who knowest too

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.140
much,
That where the tongue wags, ruin never lags?

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.900
_Prometheus._ I gratulate thee who hast shared
and dared

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.360
All things with me, except their penalty.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.750
Enough so! leave these thoughts.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.430
It cannot be
That thou shouldst move HIM.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:19.930
HE may _not_ be moved;
And _thou_ beware of sorrow on this road.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:26.770
_Oceanus._ Ay! ever wiser for another's use
Than thine! the event, and not the prophecy,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.720
Attests it to me.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.190
Yet where now I rush,
Thy wisdom hath no power to drag me back;

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:38.920
Because I glory, glory, to go hence
And win for thee deliverance from thy pangs,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.890
As a free gift from Zeus.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.140
_Prometheus._ Why there, again,
I give thee gratulation and applause.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.920
Thou lackest no goodwill.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.690
But, as for deeds,
Do nought! 'twere all done vainly; helping

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.100
nought,
Whatever thou wouldst do.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.920
Rather take rest
And keep thyself from evil.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.770
If I grieve,
I do not therefore wish to multiply

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.490
The griefs of others.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.380
Verily, not so!

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.680
For still my brother's doom doth vex my soul,--
My brother Atlas, standing in the west,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.370
Shouldering the column of the heaven and earth,
A difficult burden!

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.750
I have also seen,
And pitied as I saw, the earth-born one,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:24.340
The inhabitant of old Cilician caves,
The great war-monster of the hundred heads,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:30.960
(All taken and bowed beneath the violent Hand,)
Typhon the fierce, who did resist the gods,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.840
And, hissing slaughter from his dreadful jaws,
Flash out ferocious glory from his eyes

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.310
As if to storm the throne of Zeus.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.190
Whereat,
The sleepless arrow of Zeus flew straight

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.200
at him,
The headlong bolt of thunder breathing flame,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.570
And struck him downward from his eminence
Of exultation; through the very soul,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.550
It struck him, and his strength was withered
up

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.440
To ashes, thunder-blasted.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.510
Now he lies
A helpless trunk supinely, at full length

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:07.540
Beside the strait of ocean, spurred into
By roots of Ætna; high upon whose tops

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.470
Hephæstus sits and strikes the flashing ore.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.830
From thence the rivers of fire shall burst
away

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:20.800
Hereafter, and devour with savage jaws
The equal plains of fruitful Sicily,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:28.180
Such passion he shall boil back in hot darts
Of an insatiate fury and sough of flame,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:34.620
Fallen Typhon,--howsoever struck and charred
By Zeus's bolted thunder.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.860
But for thee,
Thou art not so unlearned as to need

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.950
My teaching--let thy knowledge save thyself.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:48.040
_I_ quaff the full cup of a present doom,
And wait till Zeus hath quenched his will

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.550
in wrath.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.910
_Oceanus._ Prometheus, art thou ignorant of
this,

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.780
That words do medicine anger?

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.290
_Prometheus._ If the word
With seasonable softness touch the soul

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.380
And, where the parts are ulcerous, sear them
not

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.420
By any rudeness.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.260
_Oceanus._ With a noble aim
To dare as nobly--is there harm in _that_?

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.340
Dost thou discern it?

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.490
Teach me.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:19.650
_Prometheus._ I discern
Vain aspiration, unresultive work.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.630
_Oceanus._ Then suffer me to bear the brunt
of this!

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:28.870
Since it is profitable that one who is wise
Should seem not wise at all.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.210
_Prometheus._ And such would seem
My very crime.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.080
_Oceanus._ In truth thine argument
Sends me back home.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.730
_Prometheus._ Lest any lament for me
Should cast thee down to hate.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:49.440
_Oceanus._ The hate of him
Who sits a new king on the absolute throne?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.110
_Prometheus._ Beware of him, lest thine heart
grieve by him.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.060
_Oceanus._ Thy doom, Prometheus, be my teacher!

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.780
_Prometheus._ Go.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.910
Depart--beware--and keep the mind thou hast.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.170
_Oceanus._ Thy words drive after, as I rush
before.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.970
Lo! my four-footed bird sweeps smooth and
wide

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:19.130
The flats of air with balanced pinions, glad
To bend his knee at home in the ocean-stall.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.190
[_OCEANUS departs._

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:27.530
_Chorus, 1st Strophe._
I moan thy fate, I moan for thee,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.530
Prometheus!

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.560
From my eyes too tender,
Drop after drop incessantly

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.680
The tears of my heart's pity render
My cheeks wet from their fountains free;

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.660
Because that Zeus, the stern and cold,
Whose law is taken from his breast,

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.890
Uplifts his sceptre manifest
Over the gods of old.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.590
_1st Antistrophe._
All the land is moaning

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.970
With a murmured plaint to-day;
All the mortal nations

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.030
Having habitations
In the holy Asia

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.870
Are a dirge entoning
For thine honour and thy brothers',

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.960
Once majestic beyond others
In the old belief,--

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.330
Now are groaning in the groaning
Of thy deep-voiced grief.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:13.780
_2nd Strophe._
Mourn the maids inhabitant

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.510
Of the Colchian land,
Who with white, calm bosoms stand

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.710
In the battle's roar:
Mourn the Scythian tribes that haunt

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.450
The verge of earth, Mæotis' shore.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.510
_2nd Antistrophe._
Yea!

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.150
Arabia's battle-crown,
And dwellers in the beetling town

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.170
Mount Caucasus sublimely nears,--
An iron squadron, thundering down

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.230
With the sharp-prowed spears.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.880
But one other before, have I seen to remain
By invincible pain

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.650
Bound and vanquished,--one Titan! 'twas Atlas,
who bears

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.470
In a curse from the gods, by that strength
of his own

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.970
Which he evermore wears,
The weight of the heaven on his shoulder alone,

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:01.270
While he sighs up the stars;
And the tides of the ocean wail bursting their

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.580
bars,--
Murmurs still the profound,

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.030
And black Hades roars up through the chasm
of the ground,

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.460
And the fountains of pure-running rivers moan
low

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.580
In a pathos of woe.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.330
_Prometheus._ Beseech you, think not I am
silent thus

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.280
Through pride or scorn.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.850
I only gnaw my heart
With meditation, seeing myself so wronged.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:31.660
For see--their honours to these new-made gods,
What other gave but I, and dealt them out

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.830
With distribution?

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.380
Ay--but here I am dumb!

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.710
For here, I should repeat your knowledge to
you,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.550
If I spake aught.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:44.110
List rather to the deeds
I did for mortals; how, being fools before,

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.520
I made them wise and true in aim of soul.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.650
And let me tell you--not as taunting men,
But teaching you the intention of my gifts,

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:58.670
How, first beholding, they beheld in vain,
And hearing, heard not, but, like shapes in

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.960
dreams,
Mixed all things wildly down the tedious time,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.550
Nor knew to build a house against the sun
With wickered sides, nor any woodcraft knew,

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:13.070
But lived, like silly ants, beneath the ground
In hollow caves unsunned.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:17.420
There, came to them
No steadfast sign of winter, nor of spring

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:24.580
Flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of fruit,
But blindly and lawlessly they did all things,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.160
Until I taught them how the stars do rise
And set in mystery, and devised for them

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.260
Number, the inducer of philosophies,
The synthesis of Letters, and, beside,

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.170
The artificer of all things, Memory,
That sweet Muse-mother.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.080
I was first to yoke
The servile beasts in couples, carrying

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.320
An heirdom of man's burdens on their backs.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.330
I joined to chariots, steeds, that love the
bit

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.180
They champ at--the chief pomp of golden ease.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.980
And none but I originated ships,
The seaman's chariots, wandering on the brine

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.680
With linen wings.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.100
And I--oh, miserable!--
Who did devise for mortals all these arts,

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.620
Have no device left now to save myself
From the woe I suffer.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.570
_Chorus._ Most unseemly woe
Thou sufferest, and dost stagger from the

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.040
sense
Bewildered! like a bad leech falling sick

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.750
Thou art faint at soul, and canst not find
the drugs

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.350
Required to save thyself.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:31.360
_Prometheus._ Hearken the rest,
And marvel further, what more arts and means

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.830
I did invent,--this, greatest: if a man
Fell sick, there was no cure, nor esculent

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:44.260
Nor chrism nor liquid, but for lack of drugs
Men pined and wasted, till I showed them all

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.870
Those mixtures of emollient remedies
Whereby they might be rescued from disease.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:55.250
I fixed the various rules of mantic art,
Discerned the vision from the common dream,

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.900
Instructed them in vocal auguries
Hard to interpret, and defined as plain

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.400
The wayside omens,--flights of crook-clawed
birds,--

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.530
Showed which are, by their nature, fortunate,
And which not so, and what the food of each,

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:14.830
And what the hates, affections, social needs,
Of all to one another,--taught what sign

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:21.510
Of visceral lightness, coloured to a shade,
May charm the genial gods, and what fair spots

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.590
Commend the lung and liver.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.360
Burning so
The limbs encased in fat, and the long chine,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.990
I led my mortals on to an art abstruse,
And cleared their eyes to the image in the

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.110
fire,
Erst filmed in dark.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.520
Enough said now of this
For the other helps of man hid underground,

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.870
The iron and the brass, silver and gold,
Can any dare affirm he found them out

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.110
Before me?

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:51.010
none, I know! unless he choose
To lie in his vaunt.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:56.420
In one word learn the whole,--
That all arts came to mortals from Prometheus.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.800
_Chorus._ Give mortals now no inexpedient
help,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.940
Neglecting thine own sorrow.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.770
I have hope still
To see thee, breaking from the fetter here,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.650
Stand up as strong as Zeus.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:14.590
_Prometheus._ This ends not thus,
The oracular fate ordains.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.960
I must be bowed
By infinite woes and pangs, to escape this

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.600
chain
Necessity is stronger than mine art.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.810
_Chorus._ Who holds the helm of that Necessity?

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:30.860
_Prometheus._ The threefold Fates and the
unforgetting Furies.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.330
_Chorus._ Is Zeus less absolute than these
are?

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:40.060
_Prometheus._ Yea,
And therefore cannot fly what is ordained.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.140
_Chorus._ What is ordained for Zeus, except
to be

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.320
A king for ever?

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.250
_Prometheus._ 'Tis too early yet
For thee to learn it: ask no more.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.100
_Chorus._ Perhaps
Thy secret may be something holy?

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.080
_Prometheus._ Turn
To another matter: this, it is not time

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.400
To speak abroad, but utterly to veil
In silence.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:07.070
For by that same secret kept,
I 'scape this chain's dishonour and its woe.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.790
_Chorus, 1st Strophe._
Never, oh never

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.450
May Zeus, the all-giver,
Wrestle down from his throne

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.120
In that might of his own
To antagonize mine!

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.310
Nor let me delay
As I bend on my way

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.490
Toward the gods of the shrine
Where the altar is full

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.260
Of the blood of the bull,
Near the tossing brine

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.170
Of Ocean my father.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.960
May no sin be sped in the word that is said,
But my vow be rather

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.480
Consummated,
Nor evermore fail, nor evermore pine.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.730
_1st Antistrophe._
'Tis sweet to have

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.820
Life lengthened out
With hopes proved brave

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.740
By the very doubt,
Till the spirit enfold

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.980
Those manifest joys which were foretold.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.830
But I thrill to behold
Thee, victim doomed,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.340
By the countless cares
And the drear despairs

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.490
Forever consumed,--
And all because thou, who art fearless now

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.700
Of Zeus above,
Didst overflow for mankind below

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.280
With a free-souled, reverent love.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.220
Ah friend, behold and see!

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.970
What's all the beauty of humanity?

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.240
Can it be fair?

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.720
What's all the strength? is it strong?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.130
And what hope can they bear,
These dying livers--living one day long?

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.020
Ah, seest thou not, my friend,
How feeble and slow

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.790
And like a dream, doth go
This poor blind manhood, drifted from its

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:28.790
end?

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.360
And how no mortal wranglings can confuse
The harmony of Zeus?

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.970
Prometheus, I have learnt these things
From the sorrow in thy face.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.570
Another song did fold its wings
Upon my lips in other days,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.630
When round the bath and round the bed
The hymeneal chant instead

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:50.390
I sang for thee, and smiled,--
And thou didst lead, with gifts and vows,

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.330
Hesione, my father's child,
